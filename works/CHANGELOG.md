# Verse Panel — Changelog
(Based on JTG Panel by Jishnu — modified by Verseedit. Original changelog preserved below.)

## v3.0.0 Release (Master Production Update)
- **Version Upgrade to v3.0.0**:
  - Full project upgrade across `package.json`, `update.sh`, `generate_scripts.py`, backend routes (`/api/health`, `/api/settings`, `/api/system/version`), and frontend dashboards.
- **Docker Container Runtime & Lifecycle Hardening**:
  - Solved `ECONNREFUSED` / `EACCES` socket connection errors with active socket self-repair and permissions handling.
  - Eliminated premature Sandbox fallback on Linux systems when the Docker daemon is accessible.
  - Refactored container creation, start, stop, kill, restart, status, stats, and logs methods in `src/server/services/docker.ts` to seamlessly handle both real Docker containers and local simulation fallbacks.
  - Added host data directory path resolution (`resolveHostDataDir`) for Docker-in-Docker / volume mapping on production hosts.
- **Uninstaller & Cleanup Enhancements**:
  - Added comprehensive `delete_jtg_directory` routine in `uninstall.sh` and `generate_scripts.py` to recursively and cleanly remove the `Jtg` working directory upon panel uninstallation.
- **System Update Automation**:
  - Updated `update.sh` with seamless v3.0.0 migration logic and pre-update status validation.

## Session Changes & Master Stability Audit

### 1. Role Hierarchy & Authorization Fixes
- **Frontend API Keys Access (`src/pages/ApiKeysPage.tsx`)**:
  - Fixed permission gate from `user?.role !== "admin"` to `user?.role !== "admin" && user?.role !== "owner"`.
  - Owners now have full access to view, create, and revoke API keys.
- **Frontend User Management in Account Page (`src/pages/AccountPage.tsx`)**:
  - Fixed `fetchUsers` condition from `if (user.role !== "admin")` to `if (user.role !== "admin" && user.role !== "owner")`.
  - Updated default admin account checks from username-based comparison (`user.username === "admin"`) to immutable ID check (`user.id === "temp-admin"`), ensuring owners named "admin" are not blocked from updating their passwords.
- **Admin Controls Component (`src/components/AdminControls.tsx`)**:
  - Added visual Owner badge with gold shield (`Shield` icon with `text-amber-500`).
  - Allowed Owners to manage roles, reset passwords, and delete users regardless of their username (protecting only the fallback `temp-admin` ID).
  - Maintained strict RBAC: Admins cannot change roles or delete other admins or the owner.
- **Admin Settings Page (`src/pages/AdminSettingsPage.tsx`)**:
  - Explicitly grouped access condition `!user || (user.role !== "admin" && user.role !== "owner")`.
- **Sub-users & SFTP Route Authorization (`src/server/routes/servers.ts`)**:
  - Added authorization guards across subuser endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`) and SFTP endpoints (`GET`, `POST /create`, `POST /reset-password`, `DELETE`).
  - Ensured Owners and Admins have administrative oversight on all server subusers and SFTP configurations, while normal users can only manage their own servers.
- **Plugin & Mod Installation Endpoints (`src/server/controllers/servers.ts`)**:
  - Added server ownership checks on `installPlugin` and `installMod` allowing Owners and Admins to manage any server, and regular users only their assigned servers.
- **Initial Dev Login Role Assignment (`src/server/controllers/auth.ts`)**:
  - Updated auto-creation logic in dev mode to assign `role: "owner"` to the initial user if no owner exists in `users.json`, ensuring immediate administrative authority.
  - Promoted existing single dev user in `.data/users.json` to `"owner"`.

### 2. Works System Implementation
- Created `/works/README.md` with complete architectural documentation, port usage rules, role hierarchy matrix, runtime switching guard, and installer instructions.
- Created `/works/CHANGELOG.md` tracking all changes.
- Added comprehensive verification test suite in `/works/tests/`:
  - `owner_permissions.test.ts`
  - `admin_permissions.test.ts`
  - `user_permissions.test.ts`
  - `runtime_management.test.ts`
  - `port_isolation.test.ts`
